                                    <p>Please ensure that all users of the CEEK VR Headset carefully read these instructions and warnings prior to the use of the CEEK VR Headset always configure the CEEK VR Headset for each user prior to each user.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-children</strong></p>
                                    <p>This product is not for use by children under the age of 10. It is the responsibility of adults to monitor the use of the CEEK VR Headset by children 10 and over.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-pre existing conditions</strong></p>
                                    <p>People who have binocular vision abnormalities such as strabismus, headaches, ear aches,or psychiatric disorders, should see a doctor before using the CEEK VR Headset.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-seizures</strong></p>
                                    <p>Some people (about 1 in 4,000) may experience seizures triggered by flashing lights or patterns while they are watching TV, playing video games or experiencing virtual reality, even if they have never had a seizure before, or have no history of epilepsy or seizures. Anyone who knows or believes they may have previously experienced a seizure or other symptom linked to an epileptic condition should see a doctor prior to using the CEEK VR Headset.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-susceptibility to motion sickness</strong></p>
                                    <p>People who may be prone to motion sickness in the real world also have a risk of experiencing discomfort when using the CEEK VR Headset. Do not use the CEEK VR Headset when you are sleep deprived, are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, are hung over, have digestive problems, or are under emotional stress. Be mindful of the content you are experiencing with the CEEK VR Headset as you may be more sensitive to some types of content than others.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-duration of use; need for regular breaks</strong></p>
                                    <p>Each user should gradually ease into use of the CEEK VR Headset starting with a few minutes at a time to perceive their personal susceptibility to virtual reality experiences. ALL USERS should take a break after each 30 minutes of use. NEVER continue to use the CEEK VR Headset if you are experiencing any discomfort.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-in the event you experience discomfort</strong></p>
                                    <p>Immediately discontinue use if you experience any of the following:</p>
                                    <p>Seizures, loss of awareness, eye strain, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, altered, blurred or double vision or other visual abnormalities, dizziness, disorientation, impaired balance, impaired hand eye coordination, excessive sweating, increased salivation, nausea, lightheadedness, discomfort or pain in the head or eyes, drowsiness, fatigue, or any symptom similar to motion sickness.</p>
                                    <p>Just as with the symptoms people can experience after they disembark a cruise ship, symptoms of virtual reality exposure can persist or become apparent after use. these symptoms may put you at an increased risk of injury.</p>
                                    <p>Whether you experience symptoms during or after use, you should never drive, operate machinery, or engage in activities that require unimpaired balance or hand eye coordination, such as playing sports or riding a bicycle, until you have fully recovered from any symptoms. if the symptoms persist, see a doctor.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-use only in a safe environment</strong></p>
                                    <p>Use your common sense. Since Virtual Reality can be an immersive experience, it is important that you use the CEEK VR Headset in a safe environment and be fully aware of your surroundings. Common sense includes having no objects or people nearby that you could come in contact with; never using the CEEK VR Headset near windows, balconies , or stairways; and never using the CEEK VR Headset while walking, bicycling, driving or other physical activities that require your full attention, or in which safe use would require you to have the ability to see your surroundings. While the CEEK VR Headset has a feature which may permit you to see “through” the virtual reality experience for brief periods of time for purposes of enhancing your experience, that is not an invitation to use the CEEK VR Headset while moving…again, please use your common sense.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-repetitive stress</strong></p>
                                    <p>Using a controller, mouse, or keyboard to enjoy interactive content can make your muscles, joints, or skin hurt. if you become tired or sore, or you experience tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours and until symptoms have stopped before resuming use of the CEEK VR Headset If you continue to have symptoms see a doctor.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Warning-hearing</strong></p>
                                    <p>Listening to sound at high volumes can permanently harm your hearing, so don’t do it. Due to the immersive nature of the virtual reality experience, we also recommend you do not use the CEEK VR Headset at high volume so you can maintain some awareness of your real environment.</p>
